# Notes App

This is a notes application built on Meteor and created for my udemy course.

## Getting Started

This app requires you to have meteor installed on your machine. Then you can clone the repo
and run the following:

```
meteor npm install
```

```
meteor run
```

## Running the test

Running the tests is easy. All you have to do is run the following command and view reporter
at localhost port 3000.

```
npm test
```
